\hline
\textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Exercise} &\textbf{Status} & \textbf{Notes}\\
\hline
Unbox BBB and follow instructions in start.htm & Exercise 02 & Completed & Couldn't SSH into the bone originally, so deleted etc/dropbear/dropbear\_rsa\_host\_key and I could SSH into it.\\
\hline
Install 3.8 06\_20 Kernel & Exercise 03 & Completed & Only hold the BOOT button for a second or so, otherwise it fails to flash to eMMC.\\
\hline
Install Linux Dev Machine & Exercise 01 & Completed & Running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my Rose Laptop.\\
\hline
Sign up for Google Groups and eLinux & Exercise 09 & Completed & Had to wait a little for my eLinux account, but the others were fairly easy to set up.\\
\hline
Gather required materials & Exercise 01 & Completed & 8GB SD cards on order from Amazon (they are ~\$0.20 more than 4GB). Also, the 5-in-1 card reader isn't supported in Ubuntu (at least not out of the box, I'm working on a solution), so I got a MicroSD to USB converter.\\
\hline
Set up Git & Exercise 05 & Completed & Git is now set up on both the BBB and my dev machine, and the course materials have been cloned.\\
\hline
Pulled helloWorld.c and modified it & Exercise 16 & Completed & I had some extra time so I just did this as well. I will pull again and modify it in class to deal with merge conflicts. I'm using meld instead of the normal command line diff, and it's quite nice.\\
